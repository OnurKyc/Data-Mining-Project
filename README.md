Data Analysis of Banking Dataset on RapidMiner

I have analyzed data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository called the BankMarketing dataset. This data relates to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. Marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, it was necessary to call the same customer more than once to access whether to subscribe to the deposit. The main objective of this study is to improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns and help decision makers by reducing the number of features of bank direct marketing data. I use different methods and algorithms to select the most important features.
